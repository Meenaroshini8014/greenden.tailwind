ðŸš€ Greenden Project
I built a responsive website called Greenden using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and basic web design principles.
The project includes:

ðŸŒ¿ Homepage: Showcases products and introduces the brand.

ðŸ“ž Contact Page: Allows users to get in touch easily.

ðŸ›’ Product Pages: Displays detailed information about each product.

This project focuses on clean design, mobile responsiveness, and modern UI styling with Tailwind CSS.
